As a Caasp developer, I need to learn GO language. While I have an opportunity to learn GO language during HeckWeek, I want to combine GO, IAAS, and public Clouds(AWS). By this project, not only learning GO language but also advancing to utilize essential GO libraries and creating a GO project can be achieved. In addition, I need to familiarize AWS api to deploy nodes, stop the nodes, delete nodes, and upload images.

I can deploy nodes in cloud easily by this project. If I can create available nodes in AWS by this projects. Manually I can try to cluster the available AWS nodes for Kubernetes nodes.
